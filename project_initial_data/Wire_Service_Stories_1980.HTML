<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Motors Corp. announced today that agreement has been reached with the First National Bank of Boston on the terms of a proposed $150 million seven-year credit for general corporate purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would involve a group of 13 major banks with the First National Bank of Boston acting as agent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new arrangement will provide an unsecured revolving line of credit for the first three years and thereafter a four-year term loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new credit agreement will replace two existing credit agreements which total $102.1 million and are scheduled to expire in July 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the agreements to be replaced is that of the parent company for a $50 million revolving line of credit.  The other is a separate agreement for $52.1 million through which a subsidiary, AM General Corp., finances its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilson W. Sick Jr., American Motors' group vice president for finance and administration, said, &quot;This new agreement is a strong vote of confidence in American Motors by our banks.  In particular, the multi-year aspect of the proposed agreement -- seven years compared with the 18-month agreement entered into last January -- is a recognition of our present strong financial condition and the favorable outlook for the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently appointed City Finance Director William J.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting Wednesday to the commission created by the state to supervise Cleveland's finances, Reidy said he hopes that by the end of the year the new system will provide &quot;better financial information than I am able to give you today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reidy said the system will be developed by the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., which has installed similar systems in San Francisco, Philadelphia, San Diego, and Columbus, Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peat, Marwick is one of three private firms that have been hired to help bring order to Cleveland's finances and rebuild the city's credibility in the financial community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reidy said the accounting system was &quot;the sort of thing companies like Lazard Freres (named earlier this week as an investment counselor) will be insisting on&quot; before the city's credit rating would be restored to where it was a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial planning and supervision commission, holding its second meeting in City Hall, named as its financial supervisor for Cleveland the nationally-known accounting firm of Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James M. Delaney, partner-in-charge of Deloitte's Cleveland office, said the company will review the city's financial recovery plan for the commission, and see that a balanced budget is prepared and that the city restores money to special funds that have been raided over a period of years to keep the city operating.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron-Brown Investment Group (NYSE &quot;CB&quot;) today announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with its lending banks concerning a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be extended to the trust.  The trust's previous </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> matured on Dec. 31, 1979 and negotiations have continued since that date seeking an extension of the agreement.  The outstanding indebtedness at Dec. 31 consisted of approximately $20,714,000 in principal and $2,750,000 in accrued interest due to nine banks.  (The principal balance today is approximately $18,500,000 as the result of a payment made in January.) Under the terms of the tentative agreement, the trust will be required to reduce the principal amount of the debt to the balances as set fourth below:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

</TABLE>
<DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interest rate during 1980 will be prime plus 2 percent (but not greater than 15 percent) with a cash rate of 10 percent.  During 1981 interest will be payable in cash at prime plus 2 percent (maximum 15 percent).  In the event the required payments are met and the principal debt is repaid in full on or before Dec. 31, 1981, the trust has the right to pay approximately $2,750,000 of accrued but unpaid interest at Dec. 31, 1979 and the interest in excess of 10 percent that accrues during 1980 by the issuance of warrants to purchase 275,000 shares of beneficial interest in the trust.  The exercise price of such warrants will be $.01 per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pete Fortner, senior vice president &amp; treasurer of the trust, stated that &quot;this tentative agreement gives the trust financing for two years during which it will attempt to liquidate the debt through further asset disposals.  The agreement protects the trust from current or any future high interest rates by limiting the interest to a 15 percent rate.  In addition if the debt is repaid on a timely basis, the trust will reduce its interest burden to 10 percent during 1980.  The banks, on the other hand, can participate in any future appreciation in the market value of trust's shares.  Such participation is appropriate because these banks, through their current and past support, have assisted in any recovery that the trust will have made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All terms other than those announced are still to be negotiated before a final agreement can be executed.  The trust hopes that such an agreement can be signed within the next 30-60 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust also announced today that its board of trustees has determined that the trust should be converted from a Massachusetts business trust to a Delaware corporation.  The conversion would result in the assets and liabilities of the present trust being held by an operating company which would be wholly-owned by a holding company.  The present shares of beneficial interest of the trust would be converted on a one for one basis into shares of the holding company.  The new entity would have the same capital structure, assets, and liabilities as the present trust.  The board announced that the conversion is being undertaken to clarify the legal status of the entity and to permit greater flexibility in future operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consummation of the proposed conversion is subject to a number of conditions including appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholder approval, bank consent, and satisfactory legal opinions.  It is anticipated that the conversion will be considered at the trust's annual meeting which is scheduled for May 16, 1980 in Raleigh, N.C.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bert Lance's mother-in-law and sister-in-law, who got big </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are scheduled to appear as government witnesses this week in the former federal budget director's bank fraud trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors have served notice they consider the two women -- Ruth Chance and Marguerite David -- to be &quot;hostile witnesses&quot; and will ask permission to cross-examine them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the federal court trial enters its 10th week, prosecutors are finally getting into the meat of their charges against Lance and three associates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once a top adviser to President Carter, Lance is charged with conspiracy, misuse of bank funds, false statements to banks and false entries in bank records in connection with hundreds of loans totaling more than $20 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two counts in the 33-count indictment allege misapplication of funds in connection with a pair of loans to Lance's in-laws on May 7, 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that day Mrs. Chance, mother of Lance's wife, LaBelle, borrowed $100,000 from the Northwest Georgia Bank in Ringgold, where Lance was a major stockholder, one of his co-defendants was president and another defendant was on the committee that approved major loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northwest Georgia made an $80,000 loan the same day to Mrs. David, wife of LaBelle's brother, Claude Barker David.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to previous testimony at the trial, the proceeds of both loans were issued as cashier's checks made out to the Calhoun First National Bank, where Lance had been president for a decade and was chairman of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money was used to cover overdrafts at Calhoun First National in the checking accounts of the two women and two of LaBelle Lance's brothers, Claude Barker David and Beverly Banks David, according to testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A federal bank regulator, Richard Newell, was conducting a routine examination of the Calhoun bank at the time. Newell testified that he insisted that the overdrafts be repaid or written off the bank's books before he left the premises of the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lance's co-defendants are Richard Carr, former president at Northwest Georgia Bank; Thomas Mitchell, once a member of the bank's executive committee; and Jack Mullins, a former Calhoun pharmacist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the fourth quarter, the trust had a net loss of $640,332 or 29 cents per share on gross revenues of $846,552 compared to a net loss of $298,642 or 14 cents per share on gross revenues of $1,233,913 for the like period a year earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results for 1979 include an extraordinary gain of $488,300 or 22 cents per share arising from an asset swap with one of the trust's line banks.  The extraordinary gain of $1,754,550 or 82 cents per share in 1978 was the result of an asset swap with one of Hamilton's bank lenders, the collection of a deficiency judgement, and partial waivers of interest notes by two banks which previously swapped out of the trust's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in 1979, the trust recovered unaccrued interest of $631,095 on an Everett, Wash., shopping center loan and recognized a profit of $801,603 from the sale of condominium apartments in Aurora, Colo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no addition to the loss reserve in 1979.In 1978, $69,641 was added to the loss reserve as the result of the sale of an asset below the level provided for by the reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Dec. 31, 1979, the trust had non-earning assets totaling $10,167,183 equal to 17.4 percent of its total investments compared to 18 non-earning assets of $16,589,326 or 24.4 percent of trust investments at the end of 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Sept. 30, 1979, the trust had 16-non-earning assets aggregating $12,435,385 equal to 20.3 percent of the trust's total investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continued decrease in non-earning assets during 1979 resulted from the return to earning status of one asset aggregating $1.4 million, the sale of two assets totaling $2.1 million, partial sales totaling $2.3 million and write-downs of $900,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past year, interest expense was accrued at a rate of 10 percent as called for by the three-year $45.4 million credit agreement expiring June 30, 1981.  However, all interest accrued in excess of Hamilton's net cash income would be waived should the Trust pay down $29.3 million of the credit by June 30, 1981.  At the close of 1979, interest accrued in excess of the cash rate since July 1, 1978 totaled $2,764,250 of which $1,214,867 was accrued during the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust has satisfied all payments under the agreement through June 30, 1980 and has a balance of only $237,104 due on the Dec. 31, 1980 payment.  To date, the trust has made payments totalling $17,920,308 including $15,762,896 in cash and $2,157,412 in asset swaps with bank lenders since the agreement was signed in December, 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hamilton continues to make gratifying progress in its areas of primary activity -- repayment of the credit, reduction of non-earning assets and increased profitability of its earning assets,&quot; Robert G.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks have agreed to lend another $1 billion to Ford Motor Co. if the No. 2 automaker thinks it needs the money, Ford disclosed Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrangement was reported in the preliminary prospectus for the $300 million in five-year and 10-year notes that Ford's underwriters will place on sale March 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospectus said Ford had &quot;entered into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Credit Agreements</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with various banks which provide that Ford may borrow, repay, and reborrow up to an aggregate of $1 billion outstanding at any one time. Any borowings ... must be repaid not later than Dec. 31, 1984.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford also has more familiar arrangements with banks to borrow another $1 billion under what the prospectus called short-term lines of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Short-term&quot; generally means less than a year. Ford did borrow money under those lines last fall when it had shipped new models to dealers but had not been paid for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Ford spokesman was immediately available to discuss the new bank arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Ann Keller, auto industry analyst for the New York brokerage firm of Paine Webber, Mitchell, Hutchins &amp; Co. Inc., said when asked if the new credit line represented a vote of confidence in Ford by the banks, &quot;I don't think votes of confidence have to be taken. Not every corporation is a Chrysler.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler Corp. and its banks have been negotiating for months about new and renewal financing. Chrysler must raise $2 billion from various sources in order to qualify for the $1.5 billion in loan guarantees voted by Congress -- a job it hopes to complete by the end of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Keller said Ford's arrangement had been general knowledge in the financial community even though nothing had been printed about it. &quot;You can't line up a billion dollars without people knowing about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford did not mention the agreement in its year-end statement given to reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford said it would use proceeds from the notes for its capital expenditures, estimated at $3.5 billion this year and $20 billion between 1978 and 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Keller said the new bank credit could be viewed as a reserve for capital expenditures if capital market conditions were temporarily unfavorable for raising money through an issue of securities at some time in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford would have to pay &quot;prime rate or prime-plus&quot; to the banks while its notes probably can be sold at an interest rate below that, she said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business lending dropped by more than a half-billion dollars at major banks here as the nation's basic money supply fell $100 million in the week ended March 26, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But recent anti-inflation moves by the Federal Reserve and the Carter administration, which have pushed interest rates to record highs, may not yet have curbed businesses' appetite for borrowed money, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Fed said business loans at major banks here fell by $552 million in the latest week, against a gain of $232 million a week before.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline &quot;more than offsets the gains in the previous week,&quot; and with &quot;complete March data now recorded, seasonally-adjusted loans posted their first monthly decline in more than a year,&quot; said Bankers Trust Co. economist Jay N. Woodworth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the brokerage house of Salomon Brothers, economist Henry Kaufman said he believes business loan activity &quot;is by no means languid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reluctance by corporations to enter a depressed bond market &quot;when financing requirements are particularly heavy is causing increasing demands&quot; on short-term borrowing markets, he said, noting, &quot;the demand for short-term business credit has not yet abated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaufman, in a report issued Friday before the weekly Federal Reserve statistics were announced, said, &quot;thus far, it appears that business borrowers who were willing to ay market rates of interest are still finding credit available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The head-to-head confrontation between squeezed bank lenders and aggressive business borrowers are still ahead of us -- though the prime loan rate has already moved up to 20 percent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one sign of pressure on the banking system, the New York Fed said the rate on federal funds, short-term loans of uncommitted reserves among banks, jumped to a record 19.39 percent in the latest week from 17.78 percent a week earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Fed said M1A, comprising cash in circulation and most checking deposits at commercial banks, fell $100 million to $374.7 billion, while the broader monetary measure M1B also fell $100 million to $391.6 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M1B comprises M1A and checking-type deposits at all financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said, meanwhile, that the monetary base rose $400 million to $157.4 billion. The base is the seasonally-adjusted total of member bank reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest four weeks, M1A averaged $375.1 billion and grew at a 4.5 percent annual rate from 13 weeks before, while M1B averaged $392 billion and grew at a 5.1 percent-a-year rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve, fearing too-rapid monetary growth will feed inflation, is aiming for an annual growth rate in 1980 of 3.5 to 6 percent for M1A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other monetary indicators for the week ended March 26 included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commercial banks' net borrowed reserves totaled $1.607 billion, against $2.315 billion a week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fed reduced its holdings of government securities by $4.027 billion. Its holdings of federal agency issues were unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve System fell to $2.097 billion from $2.483 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average rate paid by major banks on large certificates of deposits rose to 17.97 percent from 17.63 percent a week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-month Treasury bill rate averaged 14.80 percent, off from 15.61 percent a week earlier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve Bank of New York says business lending slumped by more than a half-billion dollars in the week ended March 26 as interest rates continued their spiral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Fed also said Friday that the nation's basic money supply fell $100 million in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent anti-inflation moves by the Federal Reserve and the Carter administration have pushed interest rates to record highs. One indicator of conditions in the banking system, the rate charged on federal funds, jumped to a record 19.39 percent in the latest week from 17.78 percent a week earlier, the New York Fed said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal funds are overnight loans of uncommitted reserves among commercial banks and have risen sharply as customers' borrowing demands have remained strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rates rose, the New York Fed said business loans at major banks here fell by $552 million in the latest week, against a gain of $232 million a week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drop &quot;more than offsets the gains in the previous week,&quot; and with &quot;complete March data now recorded, seasonally-adjusted loans posted their first monthly decline in more than a year,&quot; said Bankers Trust Co. economist Jay N. Woodworth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the brokerage house of Salomon Brothers, economist Henry Kaufman said business loan activity &quot;is by no means languid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reluctance by corporations to enter a depressed bond market &quot;when financing requirements are particularly heavy is causing increasing demands&quot; on short-term borrowing markets, he said, noting, &quot;the demand for short-term business credit has not yet abated.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Fed said the basic money measure M1A, comprising cash in circulation, and most checking deposits at commercial banks, fell $100 million to $374.7 billion. The broader measure M1B also fell $100 million to $391.6 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M1B comprises M1A and checking-type deposits at all financial institutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Public Utilities Corporation announced today that its New Jersey subsidiary, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company, will file a petition Monday, April 14, with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for authorization to pledge the company's accounts receivable as additional collateral for its credit under a revolving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reached with a consortium of 45 banks June 20, 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revolving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides for an interim level of credit of $292 million for the General Public System with individual limits of $75 million for the parent company (General Public Utilities), $139 million for Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, $125 million for Metropolitan Edison Company, and $116 million for Pennsylvania Electric Company.  As of April 11, General Public Utilities had outstanding loans of $54 million under the agreement, while Jersey Central Power &amp; Light had $80 million outstanding and Met-Ed, $92 million outstanding.  These total $226 million of the $292 million loan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's filing with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities results from meetings this week with the banks involved.  the meetings had been requested by the banks as a result of recent New Jersey Board of Public Utilities action removing unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station from New Jersey Central Power &amp; Light's base rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unit 1, which was out of service for refueling when the March 28, 1979, accident occurred at Three Mile Island Unit 2, was undamaged in the accident.  Its return to service, however, has been delayed by procedures imposed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which contemplates public hearings to begin later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank meetings resulted in a letter from the banks to the General Public Utilities companies received today.  In the letter the banks reconfirmed their previously announced position that no request to increase the laon limit above the present $292 million would be considered by the banks until there is greater assurance of the borrowers' on-going financial viability, including favorable regulatory action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks also indicated that no increases would be granted in the loan limits of the individual General Public Utilities companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks agree to permit Jersey Central Power &amp; light to borrow an additional $30 million without any additional collateral.  The banks further agreed that, with the receipt of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approval for Jersey Central Power &amp; Light to pledge its accounts receivable, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light would be permitted to borrow up to its initial limit of $139 million, but emphasized the importance of near-term restoration of earnings to permit the company to have access to the long-term capital markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action by the banks came after Jersey Central Power &amp; Light pointed out that it would require approximately $60 million of additional borrowings by the end of May with about half that amount needed by May 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The borrowing need results from several large expenditures including fuel, purchased power, interest, and preferred stock dividends, and state tax payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included are tax payments due to the state of New Jersey of $9 million May and $22 million May 15, which are required earlier as a result of a recent change in the tax law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks expect that the indebtedness of Met-Ed under the credit agreement will be limited to $110 million until May 15, 1980, and $105 million subsequent to May 15, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks acknowledged that the Pennsylvania Puc's initial decisions in the pending proceeding involving Met-Ed are not scheduled to be issued until May 9, 1980, and that such decisions may allay certain of the concerns of the banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in view of the recent action by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and of projected near-term borrowings by each of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light and Met-Ed, the banks believe that prudence requires an immediate statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company indicated that Jersey Central Power &amp; Light will file sometime this month for an increase in base rates.  The amount of the increase to be sought in the filing has not yet been determined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Public Utilities Corporation announced today that its New Jersey subsidiary, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company, will file a petition Monday, April 14, with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities for authorization to pledge the company's accounts receivable as additional collateral for its credit under a revolving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reached with a consortium of 45 banks June 20, 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revolving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> provides for an interim level of credit of $292 million for the General Public System with individual limits of $75 million for the parent company (General Public Utilities), $139 million for Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, $125 million for Metropolitan Edison Company, and $116 million for Pennsylvania Electric Company.  As of April 11, General Public Utilities had outstanding loans of $54 million under the agreement, while Jersey Central Power &amp; Light had $80 million outstanding and Met-Ed, $92 million outstanding.  These total $226 million of the $292 million loan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's filing with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities results from meetings this week with the banks involved.  the meetings had been requested by the banks as a result of recent New Jersey Board of Public Utilities action removing unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station from New Jersey Central Power &amp; Light's base rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unit 1, which was out of service for refueling when the March 28, 1979, accident occurred at Three Mile Island Unit 2, was undamaged in the accident.  Its return to service, however, has been delayed by procedures imposed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which contemplates public hearings to begin later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank meetings resulted in a letter from the banks to the General Public Utilities companies received today.  In the letter the banks reconfirmed their previously announced position that no request to increase the laon limit above the present $292 million would be considered by the banks until there is greater assurance of the borrowers' on-going financial viability, including favorable regulatory action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks also indicated that no increases would be granted in the loan limits of the individual General Public Utilities companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks agree to permit Jersey Central Power &amp; light to borrow an additional $30 million without any additional collateral.  The banks further agreed that, with the receipt of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approval for Jersey Central Power &amp; Light to pledge its accounts receivable, Jersey Central Power &amp; Light would be permitted to borrow up to its initial limit of $139 million, but emphasized the importance of near-term restoration of earnings to permit the company to have access to the long-term capital markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action by the banks came after Jersey Central Power &amp; Light pointed out that it would require approximately $60 million of additional borrowings by the end of May with about half that amount needed by May 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The borrowing need results from several large expenditures including fuel, purchased power, interest, and preferred stock dividends, and state tax payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included are tax payments due to the state of New Jersey of $9 million May and $22 million May 15, which are required earlier as a result of a recent change in the tax law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks expect that the indebtedness of Met-Ed under the credit agreement will be limited to $110 million until May 15, 1980, and $105 million subsequent to May 15, 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The banks acknowledged that the Pennsylvania Puc's initial decisions in the pending proceeding involving Met-Ed are not scheduled to be issued until May 9, 1980, and that such decisions may allay certain of the concerns of the banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in view of the recent action by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities and of projected near-term borrowings by each of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light and Met-Ed, the banks believe that prudence requires an immediate statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company indicated that Jersey Central Power &amp; Light will file sometime this month for an increase in base rates.  The amount of the increase to be sought in the filing has not yet been determined.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Public Utiliities Corp., owner of the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear generating station in Pennsylvania, said Friday night its Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co. division will seek to pledge its accounts receivable as collateral for new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPU said it will ask the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities Monday for permission to pledge the accounts -- amounts owed it by its customers -- so it can borrow $29 million under an existing $139 million </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">line of credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPU did not disclose the value of Jersey Central's accounts receivable. The New Jersey company last year accounted for 44.6 percent of GPU's revenues of $1.49 billion. GPU's accounts receivable at the end of 1979 totaled $123.5 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jersey Central already has borrowed $80 million under the credit line and has said it needs $60 million more by May 1. GPU said the banks would advance it $30 million without new collateral, but additional loans would depend on favorable state action on the accounts-receivable pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to GPU's annual report, the Parsippany, N.J.-based holding company and its subsidiaries last June negotiated a $292 million line of short-term credit at five to 11 percentage points over the prime lending rate, now 20 percent at most banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPU said its system has $226 million in loans outstanding under the agreement, which was signed as GPU's cash needs grew following the accident last March at the $1.3 billion Pennsylvania plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GPU could raise its borrowings to $412 million under the agreement if the banks give their assent, but the company said Friday &quot;no increases&quot; in the line of credit will be granted &quot;until there is greater assurance of financial viability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accident, the worst in the history of U.S. commercial nuclear power generation, only damaged one of the plant's two reactors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The undamaged unit, however, has not been allowed to reopen, and the unit's costs recently were removed by the New Jersey utility board from the rates Jersey Central charges its customers. GPU said the board's action prompted the banks to seek the pledge of customers' accounts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WATERBURY, Conn., April 15</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As management predicted at the annual stockholders' meeting on March 21, Colonial Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ), with assets of $1.251 billion, posted lower earnings for the first quarter ended March 31.  Consolidated net income per share before security transactions declined from $.90 a year ago, and $.72 in the final 1979 quarter, to $.62.  First-quarter net income per share, after security transactions, amounted to $.61.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Francis M. White, chairman and president, Colonial is experiencing pressure on its margins, as are other banks and financial intermediaries, due to the rapid recent increase in interest rates.  As a result, the cost of Colonial's interest-bearing funds has risen faster than the amounts earned on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank's loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and investment portfolios.  Average interest rates on all interest-sensitive sources of funds -- which account for approximately 45 percent of total funds -- reached 13.11 percent in the 1980 first quarter, up from 12.18 percent in the preceding three-month period, and 10.16 percent in the 1979 first quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A related factor is the continuing bank industrywide erosion in interest-free and low interest core deposits as consumers shift funds from lower rate savings-type accounts to higher-rate, market-sensitive instruments, like investor certificates.  Investors certificates of deposit, for example, increased from $28.0 million in the first quarter of 1979 to $77.5 million in the 1979 fourth quarter and to $101.6 million in the first quarter of 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of these factors, the rate spread, or difference between rates charged and rates paid, has steadily narrowed from 3.46 percent in the 1979 first quarter to 2.91 percent in the fourth quarter and 2.77 percent in the 1980 first quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White pointed out that &quot;the time lag between rates paid and rates earned should benefit Colonial's earnings when rates decline, and we are hopeful that future quarters will show improved results.&quot; Expressing confidence, White said, &quot;The quality of our loan portfolio is excellent, and we consider our loan loss reserve to be adequate.  In addition, Colonial experienced strong deposit growth in the first quarter, including a $17 million average increase in demand deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are gratified that fees derived from Colonial's mortgage and international operations grew at a healthy rate in the recent period.  Unfortunately, this growth could not offset the narrowing margins in our basic credit-granting activities,&quot; White said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White acknowledged that the credit restraint program imposed by the Federal Reserve Board on March 14 would limit earnings growth that might otherwise be derived from additional loan volume, but expressed hope that the Fed's actions will induce interest rate declines that will, in turn, generate earnings from increased margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the Monetary Control Act enacted March 31, White said that increased expenses related to interest paid on deposits and the maintenance of non-interest bearing reserves will be offset by increased ability to compete for deposits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White concluded, &quot;During the months ahead Colonial management will take all actions necessary to improve short-term results.  While near-term economic events cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty, I continue to be optimistic and confident about Colonial's long-term prospects, as we build on Colonial's basic strengths.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major subsidiary of Colonial Bancorp, Inc., Colonial Bank, offers a total package of retail, commercial, international, and trust banking services.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co. have resumed credit card promotions, company spokesmen say, because customers reacted drastically to tighter consumer-credit policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retail giants said applications for credit cards have fallen off and credit sales have dropped since they announced changes in their credit programs last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't intend for that to happen,&quot; Duncan Muir of J.C. Penney said Tuesday. Penney announced in March that it would stiffen requirements for credit card applicants, curtail credit promotions and increase the minimum purchase for an installment </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to $200 from $19.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement apparently led customers to believe that affordable credit would evaporate, Muir said, and Penney's is now trying to reassure its customers they can continue to charge their purchases without penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many retailers made changes in their credit policies after the Federal Reserve Board said on March 14 that companies and banks offering revolving credit must deposit 15 percent of any increase in total consumer lending in a special non-earning account at the Fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed initially said the base period from which increased lending would be calculated would be March 14, but later revised the rule to make the base period to allow for peak sales periods such as Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the change in the base period, the 15 percent penalty was &quot;significantly reduced,&quot; and retailers felt free to resume credit promotions, according to Monroe Greenstein, an analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penney's Muir declined to say how sharply card applications have dropped, but said new promotions -- including informational mailings to non-customers -- have been reinstated to bolster applications. About 43 percent of Penney's sales are on credit, Muir said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sears, the nation's largest retailer with average total credit card receivables of about $6 billion, recently started a large-scale advertising program to reassure customers that Sears will not cut back on its credit operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not believe credit cutbacks on purchases of general merchandise would be in the interest of either the public or the economy,&quot; a Sears newspaper advertisement says. &quot;If you qualify for credit at Sears you can continue to charge almost anything ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sears' credit card applications had dropped off after the company announced last month an increase in minimum monthly payments to its 24 million credit cardholders, spokesman Ernest Arms said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, which counts on credit purchases for 56 percent of its sales, began its ad campaign after hearing that customers believed credit sales would be severely limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to clear up confusion over what our credit availability is,&quot; Arms said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, helped arrange up to $800 million in credit for the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas to help them pay their silver speculating debts, it was learned Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Banking Committee accused the board of appearing to violate its own credit restraint directives through its involvement in the transaction. Rep. Henry Reuss, D-Wis., also said he planned to hold hearings on the development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government source, who did not want to be identified, said Volcker gave his approval to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">line of credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from private banks in late March because of concern that the financial problems of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt placed some brokerage houses and banks in potential jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker's approval apparently was deemed necessary because the board had announced rigid restraints on credit sought for speculative purposes two weeks earlier, on March 14. The credit restraints are an integral part of the government's anti-inflation program.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About $300 million of the $800 million credit line already has been borrowed by the Hunts to pay maturing debts resulting from their silver purchases, according to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported Volcker's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Volcker became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board last year, the board had considered itself as a &quot;lender of last resort&quot; for the nation's banks to keep the banking system sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker was in Hamburg, Germany, for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday and was not available for comment. A spokesman, Joseph Coyne, would neither confirm nor deny the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Charles Partee, a member of the board, said he did not know whether Volcker was involved in the transaction, but he said the board has been watching the situation closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole episode is of great concern to us because of its implications for stability of the financial markets,&quot; he told a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reuss said in a telegram to the board that the bank loans &quot;appear to be in clear violation of the Federal Reserve's directive ... against bank lending for commodity speculation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I vigorously disapprove of the Federal Reserve's March 29 action in allocating credit to bail out the brokers who participated in the silver speculation scheme,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuss said credit allocations &quot;in favor of speculation -- are particularly unfair at a time when the nation's homebuilding industry is in a crisis situation through lack of credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one source who denied personal knowledge of Volcker's involvement in the transaction said the $800 million in bank credit for Hunt might well be justified from the board's point of view.&quot;This can be providing a loan on perfectly good collateral for the purpose -- not of facilitating speculation -- but avoiding collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is also known that use of the board's influence in arranging private financial transactions raises questions of whether it commits the government to back the loans in the event they are not repaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an informed government source, Volcker became involved after the Hunt brothers' regular bank was unable to meet their urgent request for money to meet debts stemming from their earlier speculation in the silver market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speculation proved sour when the price of silver dropped from about $50 an ounce in January to under $11 an ounce in March. The price late Thursday was $14.67 an ounce. The Hunts have been obligated to meet contractual obligations to buy silver at prices consdierably higher than the recent market prices, which has put them in a financial bind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Hunts could not make the payments, known as margin calls, a number of brokerage firms, including the Bache Group Inc., one of the nation's largest, which were owed the money could have sustained serious financial losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One source said Thursday that brokerage firm and bank representatives appealed to Volcker to help on grounds that if the Hunts failed to pay it could set off financial defaults that would threaten both brokerage houses and banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $800 million line of credit, in which a group of banks participated, was arranged during a convention of the Reserve Bankers Association in Boca Raton, Fla., in late March. Volcker did attend the convention, the board spokesman confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identities of the participating banks weren't immediately learned, but the Hunts' chief bank is the First National Bank of Dallas, which was understood to be among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line of credit was not made directly to the Hunts but to a family owned enterprise, the Placid Oil Co., the source said. The company's oil-producing properties in Texas and Louisiana were put up for collateral, according to the Los Angeles Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his telegram to the board, Reuss said, &quot;I would like to see the evidence&quot; that some brokerage firms were threatened with collapse. Not all sources were in agreement that the firms were threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reuss said even if they were in danger, &quot;Wouldn't it be a salutory thing if a broker or two who was involved in betraying the country's anti-inflation program were allowed to fail as an example to others?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, helped arrange up to $800 million in credit for the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas to help them pay their silver speculating debts, it was learned Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Banking Committee accused the board of appearing to violate its own credit restraint directives through its involvement in the transaction. Rep. Henry Reuss, D-Wis., also said he planned to hold hearings on the development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government source, who did not want to be identified, said Volcker gave his approval to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">line of credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from private banks in late March because of concern that the financial problems of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt placed some brokerage houses and banks in potential jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker's approval apparently was deemed necessary because the board had announced rigid restraints on credit sought for speculative purposes two weeks earlier, on March 14. The credit restraints are an integral part of the government's anti-inflation program.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the day, the Federal Reserve Board issued a terse statement that said: &quot;neither the Federal Reserve nor its chairman, Paul A. Volcker, initiated any effort to obtain bank loans in connection with financial transactions of the Hunt brothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Banking officials have kept the Federal Reserve informed regarding such matters but, contrary to some reports, the Federal Reserve has not approved any such loans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman, Joseph Coyne, said he could not expand on the statement. But in response to a direct question, he said the statement that the board had not approved any loans applied to Volcker as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Volcker will be testifying before Congress on the matter &quot;in the very near future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About $300 million of the $800 million credit line already has been borrowed by the Hunts to pay maturing debts resulting from their silver purchases, according to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported Volcker's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Volcker became chairman of the Federal Reserve Board last year, the board had considered itself as a &quot;lender of last resort&quot; for the nation's banks to keep the banking system sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker was in Hamburg, Germany, for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday and was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J. Charles Partee, a member of the board, said he did not know whether Volcker was involved in the transaction, but he said the board has been watching the situation closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole episode is of great concern to us because of its implications for stability of the financial markets,&quot; he told a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Reuss said in a telegram to the board that the bank loans &quot;appear to be in clear violation of the Federal Reserve's directive ... against bank lending for commodity speculation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I vigorously disapprove of the Federal Reserve's March 29 action in allocating credit to bail out the brokers who participated in the silver speculation scheme,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuss said credit allocations &quot;in favor of speculation -- are particularly unfair at a time when the nation's homebuilding industry is in a crisis situation through lack of credit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one source who denied personal knowledge of Volcker's involvement in the transaction said the $800 million in bank credit for Hunt might well be justified from the board's point of view.&quot;This can be providing a loan on perfectly good collateral for the purpose -- not of facilitating speculation -- but avoiding collapse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is also known that use of the board's influence in arranging private financial transactions raises questions of whether it commits the government to back the loans in the event they are not repaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an informed government source, Volcker became involved after the Hunt brothers' regular bank was unable to meet their urgent request for money to meet debts stemming from their earlier speculation in the silver market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speculation proved sour when the price of silver dropped from about $50 an ounce in January to under $11 an ounce in March. The price Wednesday was $13.64 an ounce. The Hunts have been obligated to meet contractual obligations to buy silver at prices consdierably higher than the recent market prices, which has put them in a financial bind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Hunts could not make the payments, known as margin calls, a number of brokerage firms, including the Bache Group, Inc, one of the nation's largest, which were owed the money, could have sustained serious financial losses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron-Brown Investment Group (NYSE &quot;CB&quot;) announced that its annual report and proxy were mailed today to its shareholders of record as of April 21, 1980.  Further it was disclosed that the previously announced plan to request shareholder approval of a plan of reorganization to convert the trust into a corporation has been delayed and will not be considered at the upcoming annual meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Feb. 20, 1980, the trust announced a tentative agreement with its creditor banks concerning a new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, the trust announced the proposed reorganization.  To date the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not been consummated and in the judgment of the trust consideration of the reorganization should be delayed pending the consummation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the trust stated, &quot;we still have an agreement in principle with our banks along the lines previously announced; and additionally, the banks have also agreed to the proposed reorganization.  However, negotiations concerning the numerous subordinate issues which arise in credit agreements of this nature have taken longer than anyone anticipated.  We don't think that it is in the best interest of the trust either to force the pace of these negotiations in order to attempt a reorganization at this year's annual meeting or to consider the reorganization prior to having all details of the credit agreement in place.  It is hoped that the reorganization can be considered at either a special shareholders' meeting to be called later this year or at the annual meeting to be held in the spring of 1981.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust's annual meeting will be held on June 19, 1980, at 9:00 a.m. at the Sheraton Crabtree Motors Inn, Raleigh, N.C.  The company stated that all shareholders are invited to attend.  If unable to attend, shareholders are encouraged to promptly sign their proxy and return it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker denied today that either he or any other federal official &quot;instigated or guided&quot; current negotiations for about a $1 billion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the billionaire Hunt brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Volcker said he is aware of the negotiations and would approve the massive loan provided it does not contribute to fresh speculation in the silver market, or other commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which Volcker stressed has yet to be completed, is aimed at helping Texans Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt pay debts stemming from the collapse of their silver fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker testified to a House Government Operations subcommittee that is trying to clear up confusion surrounding published reports of the huge loan, as well as facts leading March's silver market turmoil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those reports had indicated potential bank credits of about $800 million. But Volcker told the subcommittee that loans could exceed that figure by about $200 million to $300 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hunts had been speculating heavily in silver, dominating the market in the view of many analysts. But their financial position deteriorated when silver's price slid from more than $50 an ounce in January to below $11 in late March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they could not pay their broker more than $100 million due on their silver futures account, the market collapsed in panic, threatening the financial viability of some Hunt creditors, including at least one of their brokers, the Bache Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker defended his support of a loan to the Hunts because &quot;the immediate purpose would be to protect more securely the interests of existing Hunt silver creditors, bank and non-bank,&quot; he told the subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He verified reports that the credit would go not to the Hunts directly but to the Placid Oil Co., which is owned by the Hunt family. The firm would put up assets to support the loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker said the loan would probably be arranged at current market rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also acknowledged that it could stabilize the financial position of the Hunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For that reason, my particular concern was that the funds not be used, directly or indirectly, to support new speculation by the Hunt interests in the silver or in any other commodity market,&quot; he testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated to the subcommittee that the Federal Reserve Board would insist on a written covenant to that effect, when the loan is finally negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker, in his testimony, also:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said there &quot;is evidence indicating that there was an attempt to control the supply&quot; of silver, feeding inflation and endangering many creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the market values (of silver) collapsed, some of those institutions were placed in jeopardy and their failure could have triggered financial losses for others and severe financial disturbances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cautioned against federal agencies &quot;striking out with hastily conceived restrictive legislation&quot; over the commodities markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he rejected the status quo, saying the problem should be studied by federal agencies &quot;within the shortest feasible&quot; time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker testified that the Federal Reserve had no knowledge of the Hunts' positions in the silver market or of potential problems in the market until March 26, when the agency was made aware of the brothers' failure to meet the margin call by Bache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During this period, careful consideration was given by me and others to possible action by the federal government with respect to the silver market,&quot; but no special action was deemed appropriate, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hunts refused to appear before the subcommittee Tuesday, despite a subpoena commanding their testimony about the silver collapse, and the panel voted unanimously to seek a contempt of Congress citation against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brothers are scheduled to testify voluntarily before a Senate Agriculture subcommittee May 2 and their lawyers said that scheduled appearance was one reason they chose not to appear before the House panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they could not pay their broker more than $100 million due on their silver futures account, the market collapsed in panic. One report described the size of the Hunts' debt at about $1.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve Board describes itself as a &quot;lender of last resort,&quot; and while it normally avoids direct intervention in banker-customer relations, it is known to get involved when financial markets are jeopardized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board involvement takes on special importance because of its new rigid credit rules aimed, in part, at deterring bank loans for speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials close to the board say extra steps are being taken by the banks to make sure any loans to the Hunts don't go toward speculation, but are limited to helping the brothers deal with their losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subcommittee, which also plans to question Comptroller of the Currency John G. Heimann, is particularly concerned that federal agencies did not adequately monitor the silver market and were not prepared for the subsequent collapse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., wants Carter campaign officials to testify to the Senate about a U.S. Export-Import </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Bank loan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> granted to an airline controlled by New York Post publisher Rupert Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wisc., Heinz said Carter campaign chairman Robert Strauss and two other campaign officials should tell what they know about the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heinz, ranking minority member of the Banking subcommittee on international finance, said the witnesses are needed to investigate &quot;the entire scope of the issue.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May 12-13 hearings will look into a $290 million loan to Murdoch's company, Ansett Transport Industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The low-interest loan was approved Feb. 28, six days after the Post endorsed President Carter in the New York Democratic primary election and nine days after Murdoch had a private lunch with Carter at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House, the bank and Murdoch have all denied that there is any link between the endorsement and the loan. Proxmire has not said whether he will honor Heinz's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Strauss, Heinz seeks the testimony of campaign coordinator Tim Kraft, New York campaign coordinator Joel McCleary and Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee had been planning to call only the five directors of the Export-Import Bank, which granted Murdoch's company the loan at an average 8.1 percent interest rate to buy airplanes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank approved the loan nine days after Murdoch applied for it, about half the time it usually takes to process such a request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Jake Garn, R-Nev.,the Banking Committee's ranking minority member, said he &quot;fully supported&quot; Heinz's request. He was unable to sign the letter because he was out of town, an aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heinz said Strauss should testify because &quot;if there were any political overtones, he would be the most likely to know.&quot; Strauss has denied any connection between the loan and politics.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker denied today that either he or any other federal official &quot;instigated or guided&quot; current negotiations for about a $1 billion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the billionaire Hunt brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Volcker said he is aware of the negotiations and would approve the massive loan provided it does not contribute to fresh speculation in the silver market, or other commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which Volcker stressed has yet to be completed, is aimed at helping Texans Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt pay debts stemming from the collapse of their silver fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker testified to a House Government Operations subcommittee that is trying to clear up confusion surrounding published reports of the huge loan, as well as facts leading March's silver market turmoil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those reports had indicated potential bank credits of about $800 million. But Volcker told the subcommittee that loans could exceed that figure by about $200 million to $300 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hunts had been speculating heavily in silver, dominating the market in the view of many analysts. But their financial position deteriorated when silver's price slid from more than $50 an ounce in January to below $11 in late March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they could not pay their broker more than $100 million due on their silver futures account, the market collapsed in panic, threatening the financial viability of some Hunt creditors, including at least one of their brokers, the Bache Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker defended his support of a loan to the Hunts because &quot;the immediate purpose would be to protect more securely the interests of existing Hunt silver creditors, bank and non-bank,&quot; he told the subcommittee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He verified reports that the credit would go not to the Hunts directly but to the Placid Oil Co., which is owned by the Hunt family. The firm would put up assets to support the loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker said the loan would probably be arranged at current market rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also acknowledged that it could stabilize the financial position of the Hunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For that reason, my particular concern was that the funds not be used, directly or indirectly, to support new speculation by the Hunt interests in the silver or in any other commodity market,&quot; he testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He indicated to the subcommittee that the Federal Reserve Board would insist on a written covenant to that effect, when the loan is finally negotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker, in his testimony, also:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said there &quot;is evidence indicating that there was an attempt to control the supply&quot; of silver, feeding inflation and endangering many creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the market values (of silver) collapsed, some of those institutions were placed in jeopardy and their failure could have triggered financial losses for others and severe financial disturbances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cautioned against federal agencies &quot;striking out with hastily conceived restrictive legislation&quot; over the commodities markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he rejected the status quo, saying the problem should be studied by federal agencies &quot;within the shortest feasible&quot; time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volcker testified that the Federal Reserve had no knowledge of the Hunts' positions in the silver market or of potential problems in the market until March 26, when the agency was made aware of the brothers' failure to meet the margin call by Bache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During this period, careful consideration was given by me and others to possible action by the federal government with respect to the silver market,&quot; but no special action was deemed appropriate, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hunts refused to appear before the subcommittee Tuesday, despite a subpoena commanding their testimony about the silver collapse, and the panel voted unanimously to seek a contempt of Congress citation against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brothers are scheduled to testify voluntarily before a Senate Agriculture subcommittee May 2 and their lawyers said that scheduled appearance was one reason they chose not to appear before the House panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they could not pay their broker more than $100 million due on their silver futures account, the market collapsed in panic. One report described the size of the Hunts' debt at about $1.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve Board describes itself as a &quot;lender of last resort,&quot; and while it normally avoids direct intervention in banker-customer relations, it is known to get involved when financial markets are jeopardized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board involvement takes on special importance because of its new rigid credit rules aimed, in part, at deterring bank loans for speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials close to the board say extra steps are being taken by the banks to make sure any loans to the Hunts don't go toward speculation, but are limited to helping the brothers deal with their losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subcommittee, which also plans to question Comptroller of the Currency John G. Heimann, is particularly concerned that federal agencies did not adequately monitor the silver market and were not prepared for the subsequent collapse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American businesses are paying back their </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a rapid rate as the economy slows, and one result is that the money supply is declining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve reported Friday that commercial and industrial loans on the books of the nation's major banks fell $929 million to $153.5 billion during the week ended May 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That followed a $1.37 billion decline the previous week and came as many businesses sold bonds and used the money to pay off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taken out at higher interest rates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing they can do to stop this liquidation of bank loans,&quot; commented Lawrence J. Kudlow, the chief economist of Bear Stearns &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve said the basic money supply, known as M1A and including cash in circulation and checking accounts at commercial banks, fell $1.3 billion to a seasonally-adjusted $370 billion in the week ended May 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decline followed a sharp increase the previous week but continued an earlier trend of declines that have left M1A down 2 percent from the level it was at last December. The Fed had set a goal of a 4.5 percent annual rate of increase during the first half of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve in recent weeks has allowed short-term interest rates to decline rapidly. The rate on federal funds -- short-term loans of uncommitted reserve funds among banks -- averaged 10.71 percent during the week ended May 14, down from 10.85 percent the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, that rate has declined even further, and on Friday the Federal Reserve twice intervened to keep the rate from dropping much below 9 percent but it still closed at 8 1/2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's obvious that in recent weeks the Fed has been trying to prop up money growth,&quot; said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve said M1B, a broader money supply that also includes funds in checking-type deposits at savings banks and other financial institutions, declined $1.4 billion to a seasonally-adjusted average of $387.3 billion. The previous week's figure was revised upwards by $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the latest four-weeks, M1A averaged $368.7 billion, a 6.2 percent rate of decline from 13 weeks ago. M1B averaged $386.4 billion, a 4.5 percent rate of decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total reserves of member banks averaged a seasonally adjusted $43.709 billion in the week, up from $42.917 billion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's basic money supply rose a moderate $800 million in the latest reporting week and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to fall, reflecting the slowing economy, according to the latest figures released by the Federal Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic money supply, M1A, rose to a seasonally adjusted $370.5 billion in the reporting week ended May 21 from $369.7 billion the previous week, the report released Friday showed. M1B, a more broadly defined money measure, rose $1 billion from the previous week to $388 billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists said the modest growth appeared to signal no change in the Federal Reserve policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M1A includes cash in circulation and checking accounts at commercial banks. M1B adds to that funds in checking-type deposits at savings banks and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekly report showed a continued drop in bank loans. Commercial and industrial loans at the nation's large banks fell $1.13 billion in the week ended May 21, compared with a drop of $1.035 billion the previous week. Loans totaled $152.27 billion at the end of the latest period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money growth, after falling sharply earlier this year, has failed to keep pace with the Federal Reserve's target of 4.5 percent growth in M1A for the first half of the year. According to Jones, M1A has declined 1.5 percent so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of declining business activity and consumer buying, &quot;it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Fed to put any spark&quot; into fueling money supply above recent rates, David Jones, an analyst at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the latest four weeks, M1A averaged $396.2 billion, a 7.2 percent rate of decline from 13 weeks ago. M1B averaged $386.6 billion, a 5.9 percent rate of decrease in the statistical quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other monetary indicators for the week ended Wednesday, May 21 included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average rate paid by major banks on large certificates of deposits fell to 8.60 percent from 9.72 percent the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve System averaged $1.094 billion, up from $798 million. The Fed increased its holdings of government securities by $4.107 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federal funds, the interest rate on short-term loans of uncommitted reserve funds among banks, averaged 9.46 percent, down from 10.71 percent the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-month Treasury bill rate averaged 7.67 percent, down from 8.58 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $730 million in the week ended Wednesday, compared with a rise of $270 million a week before and a drop of $245 million a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Net borrowed reserves totaled $1.087 billion up from $545 million a week earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary base -- the seasonally-adjusted total of member bank reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation -- was $1.585 billion, unchanged from a week earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's basic money supply rose moderately in the latest reporting week, the Federal Reserve reported Friday, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to fall in the face of a broad decline in economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic money supply, M1A, rose $800 million to a seasonally adjusted $370.5 billion in the reporting week ended May 21, the weekly Federal Reserve report showed. M1B, a more broadly defined money measure, rose $1 billion from the previous week to $388 billion in the reporting week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the growth, David Jones, an analyst at the Wall Street firm of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said the money supply &quot;is continuing to perform sluggishly&quot; because of reduced economic activity and an increased tendancy of both businesses and consumers to pay off their debt because of fears of a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawrence Kudlow, an analyst at Bear Stears &amp; Co., described the numbers as &quot;mild&quot; in light of rumors in the money markets that the growth this past week might be &quot;explosive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, both economists saw no sign in the latest figures that the Federal Reserve would change its policy in the immediate future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M1A includes cash in circulation and checking accounts at commercial banks. M1B adds to that funds in checking-type deposits at savings banks and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekly report showed a continued drop in bank loans. Commercial and industrial loans at the nation's large banks fell $1.13 billion in the week ended May 21, compared with a drop of $1.035 billion the previous week. Loans totaled $152.27 billion at the end of the latest period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money growth, after falling sharply earlier this year, has failed to keep pace with the Federal Reserve's target of 4.5 percent growth in M1A for the first half of the year. According to Jones, M1A has declined 1.5 percent so far this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But because of declining business activity and consumer buying, &quot;it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Fed to put any spark&quot; into fueling money supply above recent rates, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kudlow disagreed with the premise that the Fed was trying to increase the rate of money growth. Despite the sluggish performance, he said the continued inflation problems would make recent money trends acceptable over the short term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In theory, the rate of growth of the money suppply should match the rate of growth of the output of goods and services so money and the amount of goods available for purchase are in balance. When money grows faster than necessary, the growth is believed to aggravate inflation by providing too much money for too few goods. When money grows slower than economic output, theory holds, that could aggravate a recession. But in practice, adjustments of money supply are far from precise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed clamped down sharply on credit markets earlier this year in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. It recently eased some special rules imposed in March but maintains that it has not changed its overall policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the latest four weeks, M1A averaged $396.2 billion, a 7.2 percent rate of decline from 13 weeks ago. M1B averaged $386.6 billion, a 5.9 percent rate of decrease in the statistical quarter.  [TEXT OMITTED FROM SOURCE]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler last week stopped paying most of its suppliers until it can get its hands on the $500 million in debentures guaranteed by the federal government that the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board conditionally approved on May 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Treasury Department spokesman said the board, a federal agency, will meet by &quot;conference call&quot; Wednesday morning and adjourn until Thursday morning to make the approval final. Chrysler's 400 lenders began signing documents -- 200 pages for each -- in New York over the weekend in anticipation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lenders have agreed that nobody holds out -- all must agree to take part in the plan, which is a package of scaled-down interest rates, a stretching out of some loan maturities and conversion of some postponed interest payments into preferred stock in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler and its subsidiaries owed the lenders about $960 million earlier this year. Total debt of the No.3 automaker and its subsidiaries is about $4.4 billion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A handful of banks are being pressured to join Chrysler Corp.'s bailout plan for fear that any holdout could threaten to sink the company, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody is talking to them -- other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">banks, the Loan</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guarantee Board staff, we at Chrysler,&quot; said a Chrysler executive, who asked not to be identified, on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement by which Chrysler hopes to continue its operation, all of its 400 lenders must agree to participate in the congressionally-approved loan guarantee plan. The plan, calling for the issuance of up to $1.5 billion in federally backed debentures, is primarily a package of interest rate concessions and payment deferrals on the part of the lenders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some banks reportedly believe the plan only delays the inevitable Chrysler bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just not interested in it and haven't been from the start,&quot; said David W. Knapp, president of the American National Bank and Trust Co. of Rockford, Ill. &quot;Their (the other lenders') crystal ball tells them this (the loan guarantee) solves Chrysler's problems. Mine doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knapp said his bank is just as likely to collect the $525,000 Chrysler owes it by suing as by going along with the loan package. American National seized $125,000 from a Chrysler account in April to reduce its debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler is counting heavily on the loan program. Last week it stopped paying most of its suppliers until it receives the $500 million that the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board conditionally approved on May 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Los Angeles, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca on Monday praised the cooperation of the company's 19,000 suppliers, saying, &quot;They're not going to pull the plug on us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board has scheduled a meeting Wednesday to make the approval final and Chrysler's lenders began signing documents -- 200 pages for each -- in New York over the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts are predicting the Federal Reserve Board will further loosen its tight-money policy in order to brake the U.S. economy's slide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predictions came after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported Friday that the nation's basic money supply dropped $200 million in the week ended June 11 and business lending continued to weaken nationwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Money supply growth, seen by many economists as a key determinant of inflation and economic growth, has virtually stopped since the Fed sharply tightened credit in March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed already has abandoned some of its credit restrictions -- and the prime lending rate at major commercial banks has dropped from 20 to 12 percent -- as the economy has slipped deeper into a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By moderating its tight-money stand, the Fed has been &quot;demonstrating its willingness to allow further interest rate declines,&quot; Manuacturers Hanover Trust Co. said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further easing moves, perhaps including a complete dismantling&quot; of the credit-control program might follow the next meeting of the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee July 9, said analyst David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones estimated the basic money supply has grown at an 0.2 percent-a-year rate since December, far under a presumed target monetary growth rate for December through June of 4.5 percent annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the week ended June 11, the Fed reported commercial and industrialloans at large banks nationwide fell $427 million from the previous week to $151.8 billion. A week earlier, the banks recorded an $85 million gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business loans at major banks in New York fell $338 million in the week, against a rise of $199 million a week before and a gain of $127 million a year earlier, the Fed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic money measure M1A fell to a seasonally-adjusted average of $369.4 billion in the week from $369.6 billion a week before. The broader M1B measure rose $300 million, however, to $388.9 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M1A includes cash in circulation and checking accounts at commercial banks. M1B comprises M1A and checking-type deposits at other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics reflected a periodic revision of monetary data, the Fed said. The revisions apparently reduced the level of M1A by about $2 billion and cut the indicator's May annual growth rate to 1.6 percent from an earlier estimate of 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Fed, M1A averaged $368.6 billion in the latest four weeks and fell at a 5.5 percent annual rate from 13 weeks before. M1B averaged $387.4 billion and fell at a 4.1 percent-a-year rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indicators for the week ended Wednesday, June 18, included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The average rate paid by major banks on large 90-day certificates of deposit fell to 8.17 percent from 8.54 percent the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federal funds, the interest rate on short-term loans of uncommitted reserve funds among banks, averaged 8.99 percent, down from 9.68 percent the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-month Treasury bill rate averaged 6.49 percent, down from 6.89 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve System averaged $385 million, down from $386 million. The Fed reduced its holdings of government securities by $206 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total adjusted reserves of member banks averaged a seasonally-adjusted $43.215 billion, up from $42.784 billion a week earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Net borrowed reserves totaled $301 million, down from $320 million a week earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $159.4 billion, up from $158.6 billion a week earlier.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While current federal government export promotion and assistance programs are &quot;helpful and supportive,&quot; there are areas in which to improve the effectiveness of the U.S. export program, George L. Kappes, a member of the Valve Manufacturers Association (VMA), declared today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Trade, Kappes, Manager, Export Department, Flow Control Division, Rockwell International Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pa., noted that subjects of major concern to U.S. valve manufacturers are &quot;U.S. export promotion functions and potential disincentives to U.S. exports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the ways the U.S. export program could be improved, Kappes said, is that funding through the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIMBANK) &quot;should be increased substantially, and the interest rates charged by this entity must be made competitive with similar </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit facilities</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered by other nations.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, he suggested that &quot;even though substantial progress has been made&quot; in the area of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, &quot;there continues to be a large disparity between the import tariffs of the major industrial nations of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kappes urged that &quot;prompt action&quot; is necessary to achieve equality of tariffs &quot;which will assure U.S. exporters fair access to foreign markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his major concerns regarding disincentives to exports by U.S. companies, Kappes explained, is that &quot;our foreign policy is often at odds with our export expansion objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic sanctions,&quot; he observed, &quot;are applied without full consideration of global competition or the effect of such sanctions on the U.S. economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another disincentive to growth of U.S. exports comes, he added, from lack of access to tax credits and low cost financing programs which the other industrialized nations offer their companies to promote their exports.  Except for the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC), Kappes declared that &quot;a more effective program is needed to support and encourage exports by U.S. industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Valve Manufacturers Association represents 73 domestic valve manufacturers who together account for more than 75 percent of the total production of industrial valves.  The U.S. valve industry as a whole employs over 50,000 people, and it is estimated that an equal number are employed in supplying and supporting companies.  Therefore, the $2.2 billion-a-year U.S. valve industry provides approximately 100,000 jobs in the entire economy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the overall gloomy automobile industry picture, American Motors Corp. has revealed that its losses will be the worst ever and it is borrowing more money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smallest U.S.-owned automaker said Tuesday it had arranged a revolving credit of up to $90 million from the finance subsidiary of its French affiliate and part owner, Renault, to be used for woring capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also has won new bank terms that a spokesman said will enable it to avoid defaults on its current loans. But the new terms hold </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to $90 million, what they are now, instead of permitting AMC to borrow up to $150 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC's banks will get collateral in which Renault's subsidiary will have a subordinate interest, AMC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collateral will be a mortgage on some producing assets and a pledge of stock in some subsidiaries, said spokesman James Tolley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business conditions have changed since the credit agreement was reached. This recognizes that fact,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC had not defaulted on its loans, Tolley said. Asked if the new terms would enable AMC to avoid default, he replied, &quot;Oh, certainly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC Chairman Gerald C. Meyers said in a statement the company would seek more financing to enable it to accelerate its plans for fuel-efficient cars and Jeeps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After completing its studies and before Oct. 31, when the bank and Renault agreements expire, AMC expects &quot;that it will renegotiate these credits with Renault and the banks,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The losses, Meyers said, would be &quot;substantially more than for any previous quarter or fiscal year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst quarterly loss up to now was $51.1 million for July-September 1976. The record yearly loss was $75.8 million in the 1967 fiscal year. AMC earned $14.1 million in the first half of the current fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, AMC announced it was omitting its 7-cent quarterly dividend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current economic situation is difficult, but it will be transient,&quot; Meyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC's small cars have done well in the current slump, but sales of its highly profitable but relatively inefficient Jeeps have been hard hit. Car sales are up 3.5 percent for 1980 to June 21, but Jeep sales for the first five months trailed 1979 by 46 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renault last year put $150 million into AMC debentures and stock that could give it 22 percent ownership of the U.S. firm. The French company also agreed to extend $50 million to AMC in supplier credits or other &quot;trade working capital&quot; for AMC to tool up for production of a new Renault model at Kenosha, Wis.</SPAN></P>

The 1979 second quarter included a nonrecurring net charge in the amount of $1,083,966 or 33 cents per share, which represented the net loss which resulted from the combination of the sale, financing and prepayment of those trust assets utilized to pay its senior bank </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit facility</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as of June 30, 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Net loss for the first six months of 1980 amounted to $148,114 or four cents per share, compared to a net loss of $795,021 or 24 cents per share in the corresponding period of 1979.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">631 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've ever borrowed money or signed a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreement,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> you may have gotten -- and paid for -- more than you expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many loan contracts include a provision for life insurance and some consumer activists say borrowers often don't realize they are buying the extra protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the insurance is to make sure the creditor gets paid if the borrower dies and to protect the borrower's survivors against debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You are probably familiar with this type of insurance if you own a house; lenders frequently require the purchase of a separate life insurance policy as a condition for a mortgage. You may not realize, however, that credit insurance also is offered for small loans and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Council on Life Insurance estimated that as of the end of 1979, credit life insurance accounted for 5 percent of all life insurance in the United States. Other sources estimate that Americans pay anywhere from $1 billion to $3 billion a year in premiums on credit insurance policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit insurance was introduced in the United States in 1917. At that time, the cost generally was absorbed by the lender. Today, however, the price of the policy usually is passed on to the customer. Most credit insurance is charged to the borrower, in full, when the loan or credit agreement is signed. A lump sum, representing the total of all the premiums during the term of the loan, is added to the amount of the debt. And finance charges are applied to the premiums -- just as they are to the loan itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal regulations require lenders to disclose finance charges for credit life insurance only if the purchase of the insurance is mandatory. When the purchase is voluntary -- as it is for most smaller loans -- the lender may not necessarily explain the added charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paul Douglas Consumer Research Center, the education and research arm of the Consumer Federation of America, studied credit insurance several years ago and concluded: &quot;Because the monthly credit insurance premium charge added to most credit transactions ... is relatively small and because most consumers usually sign the authorization for it when a salesperson tells them to, without asking questions, many people who purchase the insurance are hardly aware of having done so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit insurance can be a valuable protection. On a small loan, however, it may not be worth the added expense. Your existing insurance may be adequate. If you need additional coverage, you may be able to get a separate policy from someone other than the lender at a lower price. Find out exactly how much different lenders charge for credit insurance, including interest, and compare costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two basic types of credit insurance -- credit life, the most widespread, and credit disability. With credit life insurance, your life is insured for the amount of the debt. If you die, the benefits are paid directly to the creditor. Most credit life policies are decreasing-term insurance. As time progresses and the amount of the loan still outstanding gets smallr, the amount of protection drops. Unlike regular life insurance rates, premiums for credit life insurance usually do not vary according to age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit disability policies provide for the insurer to make loan payments during periods when the borrower is disabled. In most cases, this kind of coverage is available only as a supplement to credit life insurance. Creditors generally offer either &quot;retroactive&quot; or &quot;elimination&quot; plans. In both cases, there is a waiting period. You must be disabled for a fixed amount of time -- usually 14 or 30 days -- before benefits will be paid. With retroactive policies, back payments will be made once the waiting period has passed. With elimination policies, there are no back payments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton Investment Trust (OTC, NASDAQ), today disclosed that four asset swaps have been approved by its lending banks, in accordance with the terms of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Credit Agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When closed, these swaps would reduce debt, interest notes payable and interest payable by $12,185,000, $2,800,000 and $1,863,000 (as of Aug. 31, 1980) respectively.  This reduction of interest payable and interest notes payable would result in an extraordinary gain of $4,663,000, or $2.14 per share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assets in the four approved swaps, almost entirely earning assets, consist principally of first residential mortgage loans on condominiums, a garden apartment project and a mortgage on an office building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aggregate, the reduction in debt from the asset swaps now approved would be approximately equal to the current net book value of these assets.  If these swaps are concluded the remaining non-earning assets of the trust would be $8,664,000, then constituting approximately 23 percent of the trust's total assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date in 1980 the trust has experienced losses for income tax reporting purposes (but not for financial reporting purposes) of $4.2 million and would experience additional losses for income tax reporting purposes (but not for financial reporting purposes) of $2.1 million from these swap transactions.  These losses may be carried forward to the 1987 tax year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust continues its efforts to negotiate additional swaps with its bank lenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust also announced it received a scheduled 13D filed with the Securities Exchange Commission indicating that approximately five percent of its issued and outstanding shares are now owned by subsidiaries of Deltec Panamerica S.A., a republic of Panama Corporation (&quot;Depasa&quot;), a holding company which through various subsidiaries is engaged principally in the securities and merchant banking business in Latin America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent presidential candidate John B. Anderson is asking the Federal Election Commission to give potential lenders assurances that it would be legally safe to advance him campaign money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Anderson's campaign says President Carter's campaign committee is trying to sabatoge Anderson's effort to raise money through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter campaign officials deny the allegation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Anderson request to the election commission asks for an advisory opinion saying it would be proper for a bank to lend his campaign money against the chance that he will be able to repay the loan by collecting federal funds after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is crucial because under federal law, some defaulted loans are considered campaign contributions and it is illegal for a federally chartered bank to contribute to a political candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If, however, the commission considers a bank loan to a campaign to be a reasonable business venture similar to the loans the bank makes to other customers, a default would be a loss to the bank but not a breach of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the commission, Anderson campaign lawyer Mitchell Rogovin says the request for a ruling relates to specific loan transactions being negotiated with certain banks in New York and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several of these banks have expressed a positive interest in making such a loan,&quot; Rogovin said. &quot;In further discussions counsel for one bank has raised the question whether such a loan, which has never before been made in these precise circumstances, would be ... treated as a bona fide loan made in the ordinary course of business rather than as an (illegal) contribution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carter-Mondale Presidential Committee, meanwhile, has prepared an in-house memo concluding that such loans would be improper. Sources said the research began immediately after the commission issued an advisory opinion last month indicating Anderson might become eligible for federal funds after the Nov. 4 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Rosenbaum, Anderson spokesman, said the memo was &quot;an obvious attempt to intimidate the banks.&quot; Other campaign sources said their lawyers first learned of the memo through their bank negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Tim Smith, the Carter campaign lawyer who prepared the memo said it was intended as &quot;an internal research memo on bank loans and the federal election law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was not circulated outside the campaign or used to dissuade any banks from making loans to Anderson,&quot; Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FEC last month opened the way for Anderson to collect some federal funds if he does well in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal election law provides full campaign funding for major party nominees, and says minor party or new party candidates may get a proportionate share of federal funds if they get at least 5 percent of the presidential vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission ruled that Anderson's elaborate campign apparatus is the functional equivalent of a new party, even though he says he is not establishing a third party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the commission advised Anderson, he would be entitled to federal money if he reaches the 5 percent threshhold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson also asked the commission to certify this formally to the Treasury, but the commmission refused on grounds it would be premature to certify Anderson's eligibility before the votes are counted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">BETHESDA, Md., Sept. 23</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mortgage Investors of Washington, a Maryland business trust, announced today that its trustees had approved in principal modifications of its previously announced agreement with a representative of General Investmment Management (GIM), Eindkoven, Holland, pursuant to which newly issued shares of beneficial interest of the trust are to be sold at a price of $4 per share to European investors to be designated by GIM, subject to the approval of the trust.  Under the terms of the new proposal, the trust would sell approximately 1,250,000 shares of beneficial interest at a price of $4 per share to the GIM investors and would borrow on a secured basis approximately $8,000,000 from a bank in the Netherlands for a term of one year at a rate of interest anticipated to be between 1-1/2 to two percent above the London Interbank Market Rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peyton B. Fletcher, III, president of Mortgage Investors of Washington, stated that the proceeds of the sale of shares and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if consummated, would be applied by the trust toward repayment of the $14.615 million of the trust's floating rate notes due Nov. 1, 1980.  Mr. Fletcher noted that under the terms of the proposal, GIM will also arrange within 180 days of the initial sale of shares for either (1) the sale to European investors of approximately $17 million of new convertible debentures of the trust which it is anticipated would be for a term of approximately four years, would bear interest at the rate of four percent per annum and would be convertible into shares of beneficial interest of the trust at a price of not less than $5.15 per share; or (ii) the sale to European investors advised by GIM of an additional approximately 2,000,000 shares at a price of $4 per share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the convertible debentures (or all the proceeds of the sale of the additional shares) would be applied to repay the bank loan; the remaining half of the proceeds of the sale of the convertible debentures, if made, would be invested and deposited as security for repayment of the debentures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the trustees approved the new proposal in principle, Mr. Fletcher emphasized the consummation of the proposed transaction is subject to a number of conditions and contingencies, including negotiation of certain of the terms of the loan and convertible debentures, and execution of definitive documentation.  Mr. Fletcher stated that the previously announced agreement with GIM remains binding upon the parties pending definitive modification and noted that the earlier agreement is subject to a number of conditions and there can be no assurance that it will be consummated in its original form or as modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both under the terms of the original agreement and the proposed modification, if the purchasers default in the performance of their obligations, any recovery by the trust is limited to the amount which has been deposited in escrow by the representative of GIM ($500,000), plus accumulated interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fletcher also stated that the trust has been advised that the previously announced discussions between GIM and Deltec Panamerica, S.A., has resulted in an agreement, subject to the consummation of the transaction between the trust and GIM, pursuant to which GIM-advised investors will acquire approximately 450,000 shares of beneficial interest of the trust owned by Deltec, or customers of a subsidiary of Deltec, at a price of $4 per share.  If the proposed transaction with the trust and the Deltec purchase are consummated, the investors advised by GIM would own approximately 51 percent of the outstanding shares of the trust.  If the sale of the additional 2,000,000 shares was consummated, investors advised by GIM would own 68 percent of the outstanding shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fletcher stated thaat if the sale of the shares or an alternative arrangement is not consummated, the trustees would consider other methods of seeking to repay or refinance the floating rate notes, but that under present economic conditions and in the trust's business circumstances, the task would be a difficult one and there is no likelihood that the trust would be able to accumulate sufficient funds by Nov. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fletcher stated that in light of the above developments, the shareholders of Mortgage Investors adjourned the annual meeting of shareholders to Oct. 10, in order to bring to the attention of the trust's shareholders the foregoing information.  Mr. Fletcher stated that the shareholders have not been asked to vote upon the transaction with GIM but the trust, nevertheless, wanted to bring the above information to the attention of their shareholders.  The trustees of the trust continue to believe that the transaction with GIM or an acceptable modification is in the best interest of the trust and its shareholders.</SPAN></P>

The terms and conditions of the agreement with its nine same as previously announced and are summarized below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust also announced that on the date of closing, the principal amount of the bank debt stood at approximately $10,999,000, down from approximately $20,714,000 at the beginning of the year.  The debt reduction was achieved by cash repayments.  During the third quarter the trust made principal repayments totaling $7,500,000.  The funds for these repayments came chiefly from the sale of two apartment projects located in central Florida (Totaling 420 units) and the sale of two undeveloped parcels of land, one located in Texas (33 acres) and the other in Florida (39 acres).  A spokesman for the trust stated that &quot;the trust is quite pleased with the success this year in reducing bank debt.  The bank debt is required to be reduced to $10 million by year-end and the trust is confident that this goal will be met.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

During 1981, interest will be payable in cash at prime plus two percent (maximum 15 percent).  In the event the required payments are met and the principal debt is repaid in full on or before Dec. 31, 1981, the trust has the right to pay approximately $2,750,000 of accrued but unpaid interest at Dec. 31, 1979, and the interest in excess of 10 percent that accrues during 1980 by the issuance of warrants to purchase 257,000 shares of beneficial interest in the trust for which the banks will pay $.01 as additional consideration at the time the shares are issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The terms and conditions above have been previously announced.  The earlier announcements stated the trust anticipated that the agreement would contain restrictions on operations of the trust.  Several of the more important restrictions are noted below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement forbids the payment of cash divisions.  Investment in new projects is also forbidden and limits are set on expenditures on existing projects.The amount of cash (including short-term investments) which the trust can retain is also restricted.  The minimum level of net worth required to be maintained is the lesser of $14,000,000 or the principal amount of the best (currently $10,999,009) but in no event less than $10,000,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal Election Commission ruled Thursday that it is legal for independent candidate John Anderson to get </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secured by federal funds he may receive after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5-1 ruling cleared the way for Anderson to negotiate for up to $10 million in loans vital to his slipping presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While President Carter and Ronald Reagan each received $29.4 million in federal funds at the start of the campaign, third party candidates get money after the election, and only if they have gotten 5 percent of the popular vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election law says loans can be made only if there is assurance they will be repaid _ otherwise they are illegal corporate contributions. The FEC ruled that the chance Anderson will get funds is sufficient security for the loans _ even though there is a risk he will not get the 5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson's general counsel Mitchell Rogovin had requested an advisory opinion from the commission, and on receiving the ruling he said the campaign is pleased at the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He predicted it will ''erase any doubts'' about the propriety of the loans now being negotiated or the proposed method of repayment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Tiernan, one of the three Democrats on the commission, opposed the ruling, saying it is ''extremely risky'' and would ''turn bankers into gamblers'' by making them rely on federal funds the candidate might never qualify for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This will put tremendous political pressure on the bankers,'' to make the laons, Tiernan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of money third party candidates get depends on the size of the vote. Anderson would get $10 million if he gets 15 percent of the vote, and is said to be seeking up to $10 million in loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FEC said it was not ruling on the legality of any particular loan agreement, since it did not have complete details of any. But it said it was legal for a bank to make a loan secured with potential federal funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''All we are saying is that such a loan is not illegal,'' said commissioner Thomas Harris. ''We are not passing on any particular transaction.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A $20 million loan from two Detroit banks to Wayne County will mean an end to payless paydays for workers in the nation's third most populous county, county officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a definite load off our mind,&quot; Richard Kelly, chairman of the Wayne County Board of Auditors, said Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the county will borrow the money by selling $15 million in tax anticipation notes to the National Bank of Detroit and $5 million to Detroit Bank &amp; Trust. The agreement was reached Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notes, pegged at a 9 percent interest rate, must be repaid by Jan. 31 using property tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The county, which faces a projected budget deficit of nearly $20 million by the end of its fiscal year Nov. 30, won permission from the state Municipal Finance Commission to issue the notes several weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Norey, an assistant vice president of Detroit Bank &amp; Trust, said the bank made the loan as &quot;a civic gesture,&quot; but added the bank also considered the notes a sound investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly said the loans will allow the county to pay its 5,400 employees on time starting Friday. The county has failed to meet its payroll on time for four weeks in a row. Employees have been forced to wait for their paychecks until money became available the following week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Farmers Home Administration will guarantee $341.6 million in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for 15 projects, Bergland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bergland said the plants will eventually produce 246 million gallons of ethanol a year, almost half of the gasohol production that President Carter said was his goal in an energy address last Jan. 11.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government previously has approved $36.2 million in loan guarantees for 14 other plants capable of producing 18 million gallons of ethanol a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bergland said the total loans &quot;far exceed the $100 million goal&quot; set in January when the Farmers Home Administration began to promote production of fuel alcohol. The FHA is the Agriculture Department's rural credit agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, gasohol production was about 80 million gallons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bergland said most of the new plants will use corn, but some will use molasses and potatoes and other grains to produce alcohol. The plants would require more than 110 million bushels of corn if no other feedstock was used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gasohol from the plants is intended to replace about 6.3 million barrels of oil a year for use as motor fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan guarantees will cover up to 90 percent of any net loss a lender may incur, Bergland said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects, loan amounts and annual plant production capacity are:</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Carter looks like the immediate beneficiary of the precipitous decline in John B. Anderson's independent presidential candidacy, but there's no guarantee that advantage will translate into an electoral edge over Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barring a miracle, Anderson seems locked into a downward trend, a victim of the two-party system. His standing in the polls is edging below 10 percent, his dream of raising money for a campaign-closing television blitz is shattered, his chance for another debate with either Reagan or Carter appears over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson aides insist that despite his failure to get the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he sought, loans from supporters will bring the candidate close to the $2.5 million Anderson originally planned to spend on media advertising. An aide said Anderson would spend about $2 million under his revised media budget.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate fights on, but his effort looks more quixotic every day as the specific steps he counted on to move his candidacy ahead have faltered, one after another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have any idea whether I will be the next president of the United States, or not,&quot; Anderson told an Illinois fund-raising dinner Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot of people are ready to tell him he won't be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, despite his objections, the Anderson campaign obituaries are being written and the question now is who will be Anderson's principal political heir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carter got a strategic boost from the announcement that the League of Women Voters is considering dropping Anderson from its presidential debate plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this long campaign, in which debates about debating often have proven more interesting than the debates themselves, that's a boost that Carter aides are trying to exploit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to votes, there's a wide range of views on where voters who desert Anderson might go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the campaign, Carter has said he believed Anderson took more votes away from him than from Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the assessments from people deeply involved in either of the campaigns seem heavily weighted by wishful thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no compelling evidence so far in this campaign to demonstrate a clear trend toward Carter or Reagan for defecting Anderson supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aboard the president's plane on a flight to Boston on Wednesday, Patrick Caddell, the Carter campaign pollster, said &quot;things are starting to break&quot; in the president's directions as Anderson support dwindles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that assessment doesn't necessarily hold in every state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don Totten, Reagan's campaign coordinator in Illinois and Wisconsin, says the Anderson support in those two states tends to be Republican and more likely to move toward Reagan than Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Totten is right and if Anderson's decline tips the balance in Illinois with its 26 electoral votes, to Reagan, the Republican nominee could end up the big beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reagan press secretary Lyn Nofziger noted Wednesday that Anderson remains strong in &quot;some key states such as Massachusetts, where he is still above 20 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Republican candidate's chief spokesman said his understanding is that Anderson does very well among voters who are asked who would be their second choice if they couldn't vote for their favorite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That indicates he is attractive to a lot of people,&quot; Nofziger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two states where Carter does seem hurt the most by Anderson's candidacy are New York and Massachusetts, but most assessments are that the president will carry both despite the congressman's appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Carter can claim one clear advantage. If the League of Women Voters decides to issue new debate invitations without including Anderson, the pressure will be on Reagan to agree to a one-on-one debate with the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what Carter and his campaign aides claim he wants. It's what Reagan clearly has been trying to avoid on the basis of the political tradition that if you're ahead there's no reason to debate your opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reagan no longer has a solid lead and that fact as much as the change in Anderson's status as a &quot;viable&quot; candidate could make the Republican nominee reconsider his position on debating.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Anderson said Wednesday a legal memo deliberately leaked by President Carter's campaign hurt his effort to obtain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but he has borrowed enough from individuals for the television ads he needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent presidential candidate said he has no legal evidence the memo was leaked but that he feels certain it was prepared and leaked deliberately in an effort to block his access to loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He raised the possibility of a suit against the Carter-Mondale campaign if legal evidence is found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memo was a legal discussion of the possibility that banks might be violating the law if they loaned money to Anderson's campaign, using anticipated federal campaign funds as backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson, at a news conference following a morning of appearances in Milwaukee, said bankers have told his campaign privately the memo left them fearful of making loans, since Carter may retain control of the government's regulation of the banking industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said banks, therefore, were ''understandably reluctant'' to make the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson said the mere existence of the memo was not enough to justify a lawsuit, but if evidence of a leak is uncovered, ''Quite obviously, I would receive it with great interst and pursue it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bankers cited a fear of retribution and added, ''We were continually confronted with the fact of the existence of the Carter-Mondale memorandum.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Anderson said, the latest estimate of the eventual income from his appeal to former contributors to lend money was $3 million, more than enough for the TV campaign he wants to conduct. Through Wednesday, $1 million had been received, responses were still coming in and another mailing was under way to those who did not send loans in response to the first request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson press secretary Tom Matthews said about 20 percent of the original 200,000 Anderson donors lent an average of about $88 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson also challenged a Gallup poll which showed him slipping to 8 percent of the vote nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted a Los Angeles Times poll, taken during the same period, showed him with double that strength at 16 percent. In that poll, Republican candidate Ronald Reagan had 40 percent and Carter 36 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson paid a visit to his Milwaukee campaign headquarters, then toured the Pabst brewery, where he sipped a can of beer while speaking to workers in the lunch room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers appeared stunned by the mass of television crews, reporters and Secret Service men who suddenly burst into the room, outnumbering them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lenders to American Motors Corp. have agreed to extend </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit agreements,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scheduled to expire at the end of October, to the end of the year, AMC said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreements provide $180 million in potential loans to AMC, of which $105 million is outstanding, AMC said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extensions in effect tides AMC over until its new financing agreement with its French partner, Renault, can take effect, which cannot happen until stockholders vote on the matter in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that agreement, Renault will put between $200 million and $220 million in new money into AMC and raise its potential ownership from 22.5 percent to more than 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC's bank lenders had authorized $150 million in loans but on July 1 cut off the company at $90 million in loans already made and waived unspecified loan restrictions through October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renault's finance subsidiary extended another $90 million credit line through October to tide AMC over during negotiations with the French parent company. Of that sum, $15 million is now outstanding, said AMC spokesman George Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMC, like all automakers, has been hard hit by the current auto industry sales slump. The company reported a record $85 million loss for the quarter ended June 30 and has said it expects a record loss for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day that John Anderson failed to gain $10 million in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he slipped in yet another poll, and that the League of Women Voters said it would reconsider including him in future debates, Anderson delivered a stemwinder of a speech many felt was one of his best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Something curious has happened to the Anderson campaign. As the level of adversity has gone up, so has Anderson's enthusiasm .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His audiences also are growing larger and more enthusiastic, in inverse proportion to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters have noticed the difference, as has Anderson's staff. Anderson is more relaxed and less worried about the outcome of the election three weeks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a preacher who suddenly has discovered that he has grown so embroiled in the inner workings of his church that he has allowed his sermons to slip, Anderson also has made a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources on his staff, Anderson thought he was drifting away from his original purpose in entering the campaign: to put across his own ideas. Now, he has decided to worry less about getting elected and more about delivering a message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Anderson traveled from Chicago through Milwaukee and Seattle to Eugene on Wednesday, the bad news appeared to roll in at every stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, there was the new Gallup poll that showed he had slipped to a 9 percent national rate. Then, the League of Women Voters announced it would decide by Friday whether Anderson should be included in any future debates with President Carter and Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The league has set 15 percent support as its minimum for inclusion in the debates, and Anderson is now above that figure in only a few polls, mainly the Los Angeles Times poll, which put him at 16 percent this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anderson campaign also announced it had abandoned its effort to get $10 million in loans from a consortium of banks. Anderson said the banks had been frightened by a memo he said was leaked by President Carter's campaign that hinted such loans might be illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the news grew worse, however, Anderson's mood seemed to grow better, and he left a Seattle audience cheering with a denunciation of the politics of both Reagan and Carter in refusing to debate and in refusing clearly to outline their positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, Anderson sounded like a preacher, a profession he had considered before going to law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Jimmy Carter, you have been weighed in the balances and you have been found wanting,'' he said, paraphrasing the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson again challenged Carter to engage in a serious debate, and he told the president not to let his ''political henchmen'' convince him that failing to debate was politically wise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson said he realized he was far behind in the polls, but he said ''my National Unity Campaign has already performed a number of miracles,'' and he said he was not discouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As has become his pattern, Anderson concentrated most of his attacks on Carter. However, he said he continued to have ''a deep concern about the competence of Ronald Reagan.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Plain English&quot; movement began about a decade ago. The insurance industry developed standardized forms for auto and homeowner policies.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the 1970s, the revised insurance forms were in use in almost three-fourths of the 50 states. The new policies have only about half as many words as the earlier ones; type is larger and there is more space between the lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York became the first state to pass a broad-based &quot;Plain English&quot; law, covering not only insurance forms but a wide range of other documents. The 1978 act requires all consumer contracts for less than $50,000 to use words with &quot;common and everyday&quot; meanings. Connecticut, Maine and Hawaii now have similar laws, and the Council of State Governments reports that the idea is under consideration in more than a dozen other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the New York law complain that by limiting the dollar value of contracts to $50,000, the Legislature automatically exempted most real estate transactions. They also say the penalties -- fines of up to $10,000 -- are not stiff enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York attorney general's office has brought only one suit under the &quot;Plain English&quot; law -- a challenge to the readability of rules and regulations issued by the Lincoln Savings Bank for holders of safe deposit boxes. The case was settled, without penalty, when the bank agreed to change its forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan Riley, a spokesman for the attorney general, said the 2 1/2 -year-old statute has helped consumers. &quot;I think that the law has made the agreements more accessible to people,&quot; he said. Riley noted, however, that the law can do nothing to force consumers to read what they sign. It is up to the individual buyer to take the first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plain Talk Inc., a non-profit organization set up in Washington, D.C., a little more than a year ago to encourage the use of simple language, has prepared a model law, now under consideration in the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey Seldin, president of Plain Talk, said the model statute would cover all consumer contracts, small business agreements and district regulations. It would apply to all consumer contracts involving amounts up to $100,000 and to all consumer real estate transactions, regardless of price. Violators would face a $50,000 penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seldin said there have been some improvements at the state level. He said, for example, that Virginia lawmakers are considering a bill to make insurance contracts easier to read and a &quot;Plain English&quot; task force has been set up in Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the federal level, Seldin said, &quot;there are some real success stories,&quot; notably with the Civil Aeronautics Board. And he noted that the Internal Revenue Service is striving to make commonly used federal tax forms less complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reformers still face one problem: How simple is simple enough?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some states rely on readability formulas, counting words and syllables to decide whether something can be understood by a person of a given age or with a specific amount of education. Seldin said, however, that formulas should be used only in conjunction with other tests -- by the kind of people who will actually have to read and understand the forms, and by panels of educators and other experts.</SPAN></P>

This special meeting will be held in order to solicit the shareholders approval of the Trust's proposed reorganization from a Massachusetts business trust into a Delaware corporation.  The decision of the board of trustees to seek such a reorganization was previously announced, but shareholder consideration of the matter had to be delayed pending finalization of the Trust's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Credit Agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Credit Agreement was closed during September and the board of trustees has determined that it is appropriate that the shareholders consider the conversion at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reorganization will result in the present assets and liabilities of the Trust being held by an operating company, which would be wholly owned by a holding company.  The holding company will be named Sunstates Corporation.  The present shares of beneficial interest of the Trust would be converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of Sunstates Corporation.  Except for the form of organization, the new entity would have the same capital structure, assets and liabilities as the present Trust.  The board announced that the conversion is being undertaken to clarify the legal status of the entity and to permit greater flexibility of future operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trust announced that the vote will be taken by shareholders of record on Nov. 3, 1980, and that proxy materials describing the transaction in detail and seeking shareholder approval will be distributedd beginning about Nov. 7, 1980.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heitman Mortgage Investors, a Chicago based real estate investment trust whose shares are traded on the American Stock Exchange (symbol HTM), announced as of Nov. 14 a net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 1980, of $40,767 or ($.01) per share, compared to net income of $106,252, or $.03 per share for the same quarter in 1979.  The third quarter 1979 results included a nonrecurring credit for the reversal of an $800,000 discount provided in the second quarter of 1979 which discount was pursuant to an agreement for the acceleration of a mortgage loan repayment that did not occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Net loss for the first nine months of 1980 amounted to $188,881 or ($.06) per share, compared to a net loss of $688,769, or ($.21) per share, in the corresponding period of 1979.  Included in the 1979 nine-month results, in addition to the nonrecurring credit of the third quarter, was a non-recurring charge in the amount of $1,083,966, which charge represented the net loss from the sale, financing, and repayment of those trust assets from which funds were obtained to repay the senior bank </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">credit facility,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and an extraordinary credit of $279,348, representing the proceeds received by the trust in excess of the estimated fair market value of an exchange with one of its then lending banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At September 30, 1980, the trust's allowance for possible investment losses was $8,849,000 as compared with $8,975,000 at June 30, 1980.  The net decrease in the allowance was the result of the third quarter addition to the allowance of $40,000 and charges of $87,000 to the allowance for interest costs incurred in holding certain reduced earning or non-earning investments and $79,000 to the allowance as a result of the restructuring of one of the trust's loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the trust has investments of approximately $43,400,000 of which:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A) Eleven loans agrregating approximately $4,600,000 are classified as &quot;earning&quot; (on which income is being accrued in accordance with their original terms);</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEY WEST, Fla.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After just 10 weeks in office, the city manager of this salty island town has quit, saying Key West is so broke that local merchants won't sell the city lawnmower parts or landfill dirt, even for cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of that, complains Manager Bob Sanders, his car tires have been slashed, his wife spat upon and his reputation impugned by clannish Key Westers who oppose his efforts to cut city costs and generate revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key West employees would have gone without paychecks last week if the city hadn't scrambled to negotiate a $1 million </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loan,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanders told the city commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those same city workers whined when told to work 40 hours a week instead of the traditional 35 hours, Sanders said, while the commission did its part by ignoring his pleas for a tax hike to pay off a crippling $1.7 million debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The saga continues,&quot; joked Charles &quot;Sonny&quot; McCoy, mayor of this city of 30,000, which earlier this year declared bankruptcy one week but changed its mind the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was no laughing matter to Sanders, who Wednesday night resigned after 10 weeks as city manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanders said wanted no part &quot;of a government that refuses to apply a legal remedy to making itself fiscally sound.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanders took over from Ron Stack, who resigned as city manager in August after telling the city it faced a $600,000 deficit at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports on file with state officials in Tallahassee show Stack failed to tell the city commission about the growing debt, which accumulated over three years. Commissioners declared the city insolvent after Stack's resignation, but later rescinded the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his parting report to the commission, Sanders listed his laments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city violates state health standards and creates a fire hazard because it can't afford to buy top soil to cover its trash. The supplier won't even take cash until the city pays its $100,000 dirt debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city was able to meet its payroll last week only because officials hastily negotiated the bank loan. Delayed tax collections were largely to blame but the city debt added to the problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greate Bay, in its third quarter 1980 statement to shareholders, said the method of repayment under the new loan was restructured to account for the seasonal aspect of Atlantic City's casino industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">lines of credit</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and modifications to the existing term loan agreement will provide the funding required to meet the forseeable needs of the company,&quot; said Arthur J. Kania, president and chief operating officer of Greate Bay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also notes that gaming revenues for the first 15 days of November show a substantial increase over the per-day average of the previous monthly periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our schedule called for the Brighton to open in early summer 1980 so that we could take advantage of the high seasonal casino play, but we were not able to meet the schedule because of circumstances beyond our control,&quot; Kania said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The casino started limited operations in mid-August, and it wasn't until Oct. 15 that we were permitted to operate all of our gaming equipment and to offer credit play.  The restructuring of the debt permits Greate Bay to replace cash that might have been generated in the peak part of the season,&quot; Kania continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kania said that credit play allows the Brighton to be competitive with the established casinos.  He said credit play has had &quot;no meaningful impact on October gaming revenues but is expected to improve future drop and win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit applications are being reviewed and approved.  Kania said the Brighton will begin credit play &quot;with our ability to absorb such play operationally and financially.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday it has completed work on its application for another $400 million in federal loan guarantees and is submitting it to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Washington, a spokesman for the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board said the application had not yet been received, but that provisions were being made to receive it Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revised operating and financing plans were submitted with the application, Chrysler said. Although those documents are not public, Chrysler has said it seeks a $600 million wage freeze from its employees through September 1982, a price freeze from suppliers, and conversion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into preferred stock.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An executive at Chrysler headquarters familiar with the plans said they projected cash savings of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in 1981 and reduced losses, or increased profits, in 1981 of &quot;almost a billion,&quot; $500 million in 1982 and $300 million spread over 1983, 1984 and 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the phrase &quot;almost a billion&quot; meant was not clear. Chrysler last week put the figure at $660 million. The executive asked not to be quoted by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler has already receeived $800 million of the $1.5 billion in guaranteed loans authorized by Congress. To get more the loan guarantee board must approve the application and certify that the company is likely to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chrysler says its plan projects a 1981 profit if its cars -- domestic and imported -- get 9.0 percent of a 9.6-million market next year. This forecast represented a lowering of Chrysler's goals, but it was not known by how much. Chrysler's imported and domestic models have accounted for 8.65 percent of a 1980 market of about 9.0 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Auto Workers union has agreed to negotiate about a wage freeze, but only after it confers with the loan board. UAW officials have scheduled a meeting with Treasury Secretary G. William Miller, chairman of the loan board, on Jan. 6, after his return from a vacation in the Bahamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive said the automaker was expecting conditional approval -- the condition being that all parties involved fall in line with Chrysler's latest plans. He said he thought conditional approval could come even while Miller was vacationing because the secretary could cast his vote, one of three on the board, by telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes a lot of sense&quot; to get conditional approval before new union negotiations begin, he argued, because then the board &quot;can tell the UAW there's a piece missing -- yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even after final approval, 15 days must pass before Chrysler can receive any money. The company says it can probably last through January. UAW members could not ratify any further concessions until after they return to their plants Jan. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UAW President Douglas A. Fraser has urged Chrysler to seek the entire $700 million remaining in guarantees but the executive said, &quot;You don't want to get more than you need because you have to pay interest on the money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loans at major New York City banks continued to rise in the latest reporting week, despite near-record interest rates, figures released Friday by the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nationwide figures on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">bank loans</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and on the nation's money supply, usually released on Friday, were delayed until early next week, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York figures showed commercial and industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $358 million to $51.306 billion in the week ended Dec. 17. That compared with an increase of $737 million in the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest report was the 17th time in the past 21 weeks that loan demand at New York banks has shown an increase. The net gain in that period totals more than $6.5 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest increase in loans, while smaller than the previous week, came at a time when the prime lending rate was running at 20 percent to 21 percent at banks across the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime, which is the rate banks charge on loans to their most creditworthy corporate customers, later climbed to a record 21.5 percent. Chase Manhattan, the nation's third largest bank, and several smaller banks early this week lowered their prime rates 20.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Fed's report said its latest weekly loan figures exclude bankers acceptances of commercial paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also said that for the week ended Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decreased its holdings of government securities by $3.815 billion.</SPAN></P>
